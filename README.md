# What is Android App Links
As per The Official Android Documentation "Android App Links are HTTP URLs that bring users directly to specific content in your Android app. Android App Links can drive more traffic to your app, help you discover which app content is used most, and make it easier for users to share and find content in an installed app."

What does this actually means? 

It actually means that if you want your app to be accessible from a URL link, may be when a user hit a URL link in a chat app (like whatsapp, messenger, .. etc), then you should implement the Android App Links. You could also not just open your app But also send some specific data with the URL to open a specific location in your app with a specific content. For Example, when someone shares his facebook profile link in the messenger, when you hit this URL link, the facebook app will open the profile screen of this user. So in other words, you have extent the functionality of your app to allow sharing a direct link of user profile, may be a user blog or even a certain specific post. 

# Here are the actual benefits from using the Android App Links:
1. Making more than one entry point for your application.
This means you could open your app from places rather than the launch icon

2. Extending the functionality of your app by allowing sharing a specific content over the social media even if you don't have a website :)

3. Improving the User Experience by facilitating a direct access to the content that the user need without the need of opening your app from the launcher icon then browsing to the desired content.

4. Increase the user's engagement with your app as you could allow him to browse the app as if he opens it from the launcher icon.
This means when he press the Up button in the ActionBar/ToolBar, he will go to the normal previous screen as if he opened the app from the normal entry point (launcher icon). You could also prevent this action by allowing the Up button to leave your app and return to the previous app which redirected the user to your app.
